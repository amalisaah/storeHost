## Overview
This project was submitted as a capstone project at the end of Amalitech graduate training
### Project Objective

Many small and micro companies in Ghana find themselves in need of a storefront for
their products. They mostly contact the services of software developers to build custom
software for them.
Given a unified ecosystem where companies have access to our database and can
employ point-and-click to edit a desired template, give companies the opportunity to
release new changes quickly and access to a wider user-base and marketing
opportunities that come along with it.
